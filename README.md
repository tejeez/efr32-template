# Template for EFR32 programming

See example/ for a Makefile template and a small example program
for EFR32FG13P231F512GM48.

Edit the Makefile to add source files, include paths and defines
for your program.

Edit the `GECKOSDK` variable to point to the correct path within
a Simplicity Studio installation. It's also possible to copy the
necessary SDK files into the same repository and use a relative path.

To change the EFR32 chip, edit the Makefile below the comment
"EFR32 chip specific parts".

The Makefile can be also used for other microcontrollers by changing
SDK paths, linker script, startup code and processor core configuration.
Some parts are actually based on Makefiles generated by STM32CubeMX.


# Using command line tools on Ubuntu

Install ARM toolchain:

    sudo apt install make gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi gdb-multiarch openocd

Compile the program:

    cd example
    make

To program and debug the chip, start OpenOCD:

    openocd -f board/efm32.cfg

While OpenOCD is running, start GDB:

    gdb-multiarch build/example.elf -ex "tar rem :3333"

Use these GDB commands to flash and run the program:

    load
    mon reset halt
    c
